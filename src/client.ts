/**
 * Base interface and implementation for Client implementations.
 *
 * A `Client` implementation, along with a `Transfer` implementation, defines a
 * way for this library to make HTTP requests, collect HTTP responses, and
 * allow monitoring of progress in between.
 *
 * This allows abstraction of the rest of the library away from details like
 * e.g. whether one is using Angular or vanilla XHR, fetch, Node, Bluebird,
 * ES2017 with async, etc. Then code for various things like validating
 * parameters, generating requests, parsing responses and creating nice objects
 * for results can be shared across implementations, because it is not coupled
 * to any particular implementation.
 *
 * And this allows users of this shared code to exploit it from whatever
 * environment *their* code wants to run in. It's a politeness when you have
 * people who want to use your code across different kinds of environments.
