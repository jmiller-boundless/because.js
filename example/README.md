How to run
----------

Step by step, if you are at the root of the repo:
1. `cd example`
2. `npm i`
3. (Wait a while for about 5348 dependencies to install in `node_modules/`)
4. `npm start`

Note that this installs because.js from `..`. 

It means that if you change because.js, you might have to reinstall.

Also, the react server thingy run by `npm start` may have to be killed and
restarted if it's caching things that were changed. Yes, I know this needs a
better setup, but on the other hand it's just an example.
